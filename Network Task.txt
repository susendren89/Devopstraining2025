Get me the IP address of a particular domain (guvi.in) --> nslookup guvi.in
How do I find my CPU/memory usage of my server --> top(for real time usage), vmstat(get a brief snapshot), free -h(check memory usage)
Test the connectivity between 2 nodes --> Ping hostname or IP Address (note - firewall should be enabled in respective node to check connection)
I have deployed an application in guvi.com:9000, and logs show my app is running, but Iâ€™m unable to view the page. Check whether my port is open or not
 i) nc -zv guvi.com 9000
 ii) telnet guvi.com 9000
 iii) curl -v http://guvi.com:9000
